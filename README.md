<h1>ðŸ§¾ App Description</h1>
This is a web-based application built with Next.js for listing network devices available for sale. The app provides a simple, responsive interface where users can view devices such as switches, routers, and other IT equipment.

The main goal is to allow internal staff or clients to quickly browse available hardware, with each item displaying important details like make, model, serial number, and status.

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and TypeScript for improved code quality. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.
