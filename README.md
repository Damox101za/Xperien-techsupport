# Network Devices Listing App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web application for displaying and managing a list of **network devices for sale**. It was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and is built using modern tools like TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the Next.js App Router.

## 📦 Features

* Dynamic listing of devices (data-driven)
* Clean and responsive UI
* Easy to extend and customize
* Built with scalability in mind
* Logo and branding ready
* Powered by the App Router (`app/` directory)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
